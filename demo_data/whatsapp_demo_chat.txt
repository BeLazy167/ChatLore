[2/15/24, 9:16:12 AM] Alex Chen: Perfect. I've reserved our usual table

[2/15/24, 9:18:30 AM] Taylor Smith: Sorry guys, I might be 10 minutes late. Have to drop my kid at school first

[2/15/24, 9:19:05 AM] Alex Chen: No problem Taylor, we'll wait for you

[2/15/24, 9:20:11 AM] Jamie Wong: @Taylor can you bring the project files on your laptop? Mine is being repaired

[2/15/24, 9:21:45 AM] Taylor Smith: Sure thing. I have everything saved on my drive

[2/15/24, 10:45:23 AM] Alex Chen: By the way, I just got off the phone with the client. They want to move the deadline up to next Friday

[2/15/24, 10:46:15 AM] Jamie Wong: What?! That's a week earlier than planned! ðŸ˜±

[2/15/24, 10:47:30 AM] Taylor Smith: That's going to be tight. We'll need to work overtime to make it happen

[2/15/24, 10:48:12 AM] Alex Chen: I know, I tried to push back but they're firm on this. They're offering a 15% bonus if we deliver on time

[2/15/24, 10:49:05 AM] Jamie Wong: Well, that helps a bit. Let's discuss the details tomorrow

[2/16/24, 10:05:12 AM] Alex Chen: I'm at the coffee shop now. Got us a table in the back

[2/16/24, 10:06:30 AM] Jamie Wong: Walking in now. I see you

[2/19/24, 8:30:15 AM] Alex Chen: Morning update: The client just sent over some new requirements. I've added them to our task board

[2/19/24, 8:32:45 AM] Jamie Wong: Are they expecting these to be included in Friday's deadline too?

[2/19/24, 8:33:30 AM] Alex Chen: Unfortunately, yes. But they're relatively minor changes

[2/19/24, 8:34:15 AM] Taylor Smith: I'll take a look. Might need to reprioritize some tasks

[2/19/24, 8:35:30 AM] Alex Chen: Thanks Taylor. Let's have a quick stand-up at 9:30 to discuss

[2/19/24, 14:22:45 PM] Jamie Wong: Hey, can someone send me the AWS access credentials again? I need to deploy the latest changes
